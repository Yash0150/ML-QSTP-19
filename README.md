# ML-QSTP-19
in the first task of ml qstp, we were supposed complete an assignment which was based on the lecture slides and the videos shared on the qstp group. The assignment had tasks based on linear regression, gradient decent, normalization and normal equation. Through this we learnt how to implement machine learning through python.
